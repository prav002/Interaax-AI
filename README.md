This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.

## Learn More

To learn more about Next.js, take a look at the following resources:

- [Next.js Documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs) - learn about Next.js features and API.
- [Learn Next.js](https://nextjs.org/learn) - an interactive Next.js tutorial.

You can check out [the Next.js GitHub repository](https://github.com/vercel/next.js) - your feedback and contributions are welcome!

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.

This is a great plan for developing an e-commerce website with Next.js! Below are some additional tips and a breakdown to ensure each feature is implemented effectively:

Project Setup and Dependencies
Next.js and Tailwind CSS: Start by setting up a Next.js app with Tailwind CSS for styling:

bash
Copy code
npx create-next-app@latest my-ecommerce-app
cd my-ecommerce-app
npm install tailwindcss postcss autoprefixer
npx tailwindcss init -p
Configure Tailwind in tailwind.config.js and add it to your CSS imports.

Install Dependencies:

NextAuth.js for authentication
Axios or Fetch for API calls to Fake Store API
React Context or Redux for state management
Testing Libraries: Jest and React Testing Library
Deployment Tools: Set up Git for version control and plan deployment on Vercel/Netlify.
Feature Breakdown
1. UI Implementation
Figma to Next.js: Reproduce Figma designs using reusable components for headers, product cards, footers, etc.
Tailwind CSS: Use responsive design utilities for layout adjustments. Create mobile-first designs that adapt based on screen sizes.
2. API Integration
Use the Fake Store API to retrieve products:
javascript
Copy code
const fetchProducts = async () => {
  const response = await fetch('https://fakestoreapi.com/products');
  return response.json();
};
Implement dynamic routing in Next.js for product details (pages/product/[id].js) to show individual product data.
3. Authentication System
Set up NextAuth.js for user authentication. Use providers such as Google or GitHub for OAuth:
javascript
Copy code
import NextAuth from 'next-auth';
import Providers from 'next-auth/providers';

export default NextAuth({
  providers: [
    Providers.Google({
      clientId: process.env.GOOGLE_ID,
      clientSecret: process.env.GOOGLE_SECRET,
    }),
  ],
});
Protect routes for admin-only actions like CRUD operations using getSession() to check user roles.
4. Product CRUD Operations
Admin Panel: Create a page with conditional access where admins can add/edit/delete products.
Implement client-side forms for adding/editing products, along with API routes (/pages/api/products.js) for backend operations.
5. Shopping Cart Functionality
Use local storage for cart persistence or directly interact with API endpoints for cart management.
Create a global cart context to handle adding/removing products and quantity adjustments.
6. Responsive Design
Test the UI on different screen sizes using Tailwindâ€™s responsive classes (e.g., sm:, md:, lg:).
Ensure all components adapt seamlessly between mobile and desktop views.
7. Checkout Process
Design checkout pages for reviewing cart, entering shipping details, and confirming purchases.
Use dummy data for payment or integrate with services like Stripe for more robust implementation.
8. State Management
Implement Context API or Redux to handle cart state and user data globally.
Structure state providers in _app.js for seamless access across pages.
9. SEO Optimization
Use next/head to add metadata for SEO, including page titles, descriptions, and structured data for products.
10. Testing and Deployment
Write unit tests for key components like ProductCard, Cart, and pages like Checkout.
Write integration tests for flows such as login, adding to cart, and checkout.
Deploy on Vercel or Netlify after ensuring production readiness.
Stretch Goals
Search and Filters:

Implement search functionality with a debounce for efficient live search.
Use query parameters for filtering and sorting products.
User Dashboard:

Develop a dashboard for users to track orders, view purchase history, and manage account settings.
